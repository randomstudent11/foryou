          <p>I feel like sometimes we can all be looking at the same thing but SEEING something different.
          I took this photograph before going for a surf one day.
          Everyone else was focussed on the waves crashing onto the shore and didn't even notice the beauty going on before them.
          It almost appears divine, the way the light streams through the clouds like this.
          It's so easy to get caught up in things, especially with a fast pace worklife.
          Or sometimes when we are so absorbed in the negatives that life throws at us.
          We can neglect to take a minute just to see the beauty that is in our lives.
          Just like this photo, sometimes we can be surrounded by dark clouds but we should always remember that there is light on the other side.</p>

            <em>"Always end the day with a positive thought. <br>
              No matter how hard things were, <br>
              tomorrow's a fresh opportunity to make it better."<br>

<p style="text-align:center">Here I am writing this and thinking about my message to you... Be happy!
<br>
Sounds so simple... but how do we become a happy person?
<br>
Being a happy person doesn't mean that we are happy 100% of the time.
<br>
It's totally normal and ok to feel all the negative emotions as well.
<br>
The important thing is to be kind to yourself and not beat yourself up.
<br>
Just keep things simple and do the kinds of things you enjoy.
<br>
Make sure to keep in touch with family and friends
<br>
<br>
And just remember that you're an amazing girl who is super kind and friendly.
<br>
Don't underestimate yourself or sell yourself short.
<br>
You can overcome any challenge you face.
<br>
And I'll always be here for you =)
